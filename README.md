# KNNStuff
K-Nearest Neighbors STreaming Unit for FPGA (KNNStuff) is a scalable RTL implementation of the KNN classifier. Since the design is highly reconfigurable, KNNStuff can be implemented in FPGAs of all sizes.

## Content of this repository
* `/rtl`: contains the VHDL files and the Xilinx IP files to generate the custom IP cores;
* `/scripts`: contains auxiliary scripts to help building the project;
* `/src`: contains the source code of the KNN classifier.

## Pre-requisites
To use KNNStuff, the minimum requisits are demanded:
* A host computer running Linux;
* Xilinx Vivado 2018.3 (follow [this](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/2018-3.html) link to download);
* A Xilinx SoC (this tutorial uses the Diligent Zybo board, but all procedures are also valid for the ZedBoard);
* A micro USB cable to connect the board to the host computer;
